<h1>Project name</h1> </br>
<p><h3>Gecho</h3> (Name just for development purposes,it will be changed soon)</p></br>
<h2>Description</h2> </br>
<p>"Gecho" is a website that was created as a store site for a friend of mine. It will be further developed in near future to make it a commercial app. Even though, the site is fully functional. For now I put some dummy logo, data and products that came to my mind. It is a dynamic website with server connections and Google Maps JavaScript Api. In the future, the site will be used as contact and advertisement website for fish-selling business. The website is fully responsive. Also this website was an opportunity to improve some features that I included in Fiszkando project eg. more dynamic sidebar and better usage of intersection observer API.</p> <br/>
<h2>Technological Stack</h2> </br>
<p><b>React, React Redux Toolkit, React Router v6, Google Maps JavaScript Api, CSS, CSS modules, REST API, Material UI.</b></p> <br/>
<h2>Project Status</h2> </br>
<p>Second fully functional, dynamic version is finished. It is not for commercial purposes yet. Third, commercial version will be created when my friend will need it. Even though this version is not commercial, it contains all features that commercial version will have.</p> <br/>
