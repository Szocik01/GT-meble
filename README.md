<h1>Project name</h1> </br>
<p><h3>Gecho</h3> (Name just for development purposes,it will be changed soon)</p></br>
<h2>Description</h2> </br>
<p>"Gecho" is a website that was created as a first version of a store site for a friend of mine. It will be further developed in near future, after my friend will specify his needs. Even though, the site is fully functional. For now I put some dummy logo and products that came to my mind. It is a simple, static website without any server connections except Google Maps JavaScript Api. In the future, the site will be used as contact and advertisement website for fish-selling business. The website is fully responsive. Also this website was an opportunity to improve some features that I included in Fiszkando project eg. more dynamic sidebar and better usage of intersection observer API.</p> <br/>
<h2>Technological Stack</h2> </br>
<p><b>React, React Redux Toolkit, React Router v6, Google Maps JavaScript Api, CSS, CSS modules.</b></p> <br/>
<h2>Project Status</h2> </br>
<p>First fully functional but static version is finished. Second version, connected to server through RestAPI is during development and will be updated soon.</p> <br/>
